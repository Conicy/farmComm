farmComm
========

Spawns arbitrary, configurable processes, optionally (partly) hidden, when any user is idle for a designated amount of time. User must be logged in. Terminates and respawns those processes on user switch (to always run them in the active session). Built with AutoHotkey_L, designed for Windows 7.
